auto-not
========

A Chrome extension to pause autoplay on HTML5 `video` and `audio` content. No need to revisit the horrible olden times of [Shockwave or MIDI file ambush](http://xkcd.com/134/).

Much inspiration taken from the wholly essential [Gif Stopper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gif-stopper/eaebhojnielfeoillcfnbmkgliokndkm) extension by Terry Moore.
